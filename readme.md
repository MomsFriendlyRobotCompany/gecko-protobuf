# Google Protobuf Messages for [Gecko](https://github.com/gecko-robotics/gecko)

A lot good ideas were pulled from [ROS common messages](http://wiki.ros.org/common_msgs?distro=melodic). In order to simplify thinigs, all messages
live in the same namespace. Some of the default messages available are:

- Quaternion
- Vector
- Twist
- Wrench
- Transform
- Imu
- LidarScan
- Image
- CameraInfo
- NavSatFix
- Pose

This is not an all inclusive list.
